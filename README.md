# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

For this project I used JQuery, HTML, and CSS to create a responsive and intuitive work day scheduler.

Here are some key features:

1. A date and time that auto updates each time the page is refreshed.
2. Nine timeblocks, each for an hour of the workday, where the user can input events.
3. For each timeblock a save button that only saves text inputs for that specific timeblock.
4. For each timeblock a clear button that only clears text inputs for that specific timeblock.
5. Timeblocks automatically change color depending on if they're in the past, present, or future.
6. A "Save All" button that saves text inputs for every timeblock.
7. A "Clear All" button that clears all text inputs for every timeblock.
8. Save buttons that save user text inputs into local storage.
9. Timeblocks auto-fill if local storage is available.
