# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

For this project I used Javascript, HTML, and CSS to create a multi question, multiple choice quiz.

Here are some key features:

1. Start button that initializes a countdown and then the quiz itself
2. A timer that will terminate the quiz if it reaches zero. The timer is also tracked for the final score.
3. Ten unique questions with four answers for the user to choose from.
4. When the user selects an answer the program will alert the user if it was correct or incorrect.
5. A final score that is a combination of the correct amount of answers (each is worth 3 points) and the time remaining.
6. A scoreboard that auto generates based on the amount of saved scores in local storage.
7. A scoreboard that orders the scores from highest to lowest.
7. A button that will clear all highscores.
8. A button that will restart the quiz.
9. A score tracker so the user can see their current score while taking the quiz.
